Hackathon project – Sustainable Second-Hand Marketplace
# EcoFinds 🌱
*A simple second-hand marketplace for students and communities*

---

## 🚩 Problem
Many usable items like books, clothes, and gadgets are often thrown away or kept unused.  
At the same time, people (especially students) struggle to buy the same items at high prices.  

There is no simple platform where people can **easily sell or buy second-hand products** in a safe and eco-friendly way.

## 💡 Our Idea
We built **EcoFinds** – a basic marketplace where anyone can:
- Put up items they don’t use anymore
- Browse and buy second-hand products
- Save money while also reducing waste  

.......  

## 🔑 Features (for now)
- Login / Signup  
- Add a product with details and image  
- Browse products by category  
- Product detail page  
- Cart or Wishlist
- Profile page (My Listings, Logout)  

*(This is our MVP – Minimum Viable Product for hackathon)*

.......

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Figma** → UI/UX prototype  
- **Canva/Google Slides** → Pitch presentation

- *(Optional, if time allows)* Firebase + React/HTML for demo
